# WebDav Penetration Test

This repository contains a comprehensive assessment, analysis, and hardening guide for systems utilizing Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV). The project encompasses:
- Network Topology: Visual representation and explanation of the network setup.
- Red Team Activities: Security assessment, exploitation techniques, and methods to avoid detection.
- Blue Team Activities: Log analysis, threat characterization, and defensive measures.
- Hardening Strategies: Mitigation techniques to secure WebDAV implementations.

## Introduction
WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers. While it offers enhanced functionality, improper configuration can introduce security vulnerabilities. This project aims to identify potential weaknesses in WebDAV implementations and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate associated risks.

## Network Topology
The network topology section provides a detailed diagram and explanation of the environment used for testing. Understanding the network layout is crucial for both offensive and defensive security operations.

## Red Team Activities
This section delves into offensive security measures, including:
- Security Assessment: Identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities within the WebDAV setup.
- Exploitation Techniques: Methods to exploit identified vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized file access or code execution.
- Avoiding Detection: Strategies to remain undetected during penetration testing activities.

For instance, exploiting WebDAV vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized code execution on the server. It's essential to understand these attack vectors to effectively defend against them.

## Blue Team Activities
Defensive measures are outlined in this section, focusing on:
- Log Analysis: Monitoring and analyzing logs to detect suspicious activities related to WebDAV.
- Threat Characterization: Understanding the nature and potential impact of detected threats.
- Defensive Measures: Implementing security controls to prevent or mitigate attacks.

Regular monitoring can help identify unauthorized WebDAV usage, which may indicate potential security breaches.

## Hardening Strategies
To secure WebDAV implementations, consider the following recommendations:
- Disable WebDAV if Unused: Many web servers enable WebDAV by default. If not required, it's advisable to disable it to reduce potential attack surfaces. 
- Implement Proper Authentication: Ensure that only authorized users have access to WebDAV resources.
- Regularly Update and Patch: Keep the server and WebDAV modules up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- Restrict HTTP Methods: Limit the HTTP methods allowed on the server to those necessary for functionality, reducing potential exploitation vectors.
